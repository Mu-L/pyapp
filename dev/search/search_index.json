Project \u00b6 There are 3 ways to configure runtime installation, none of which will occur when disabled . The project name and version must be known in all cases. Package index \u00b6 The desired project name and version are configured with the PYAPP_PROJECT_NAME and PYAPP_PROJECT_VERSION options, respectively. The project name must adhere to PEP 508 and will be normalized during builds according to PEP 503 . Dependency file \u00b6 You may install your project using a dependency file with the PYAPP_PROJECT_DEPENDENCY_FILE option which should be a local path to the file. In this mode, the project name and version have nothing to do with installation and are just used as metadata. The following formats are supported: Extensions Description .txt .in This is the requirements file format Embedding \u00b6 You may embed the project with the PYAPP_PROJECT_PATH option which should be a path to a wheel ending in .whl or a source distribution ending in .tar.gz . Note The project name and version is automatically derived from the metadata files inside. Execution mode \u00b6 The following options are mutually exclusive: Option Description PYAPP_EXEC_MODULE This is the name of the module to execute via python -m <MODULE> PYAPP_EXEC_SPEC This is an object reference to execute e.g. pkg.foo:cli PYAPP_EXEC_CODE This is arbitrary code to run via python -c <CODE> (the spec option uses this internally) If none are set then the PYAPP_EXEC_MODULE option will default to the value of PYAPP_PROJECT_NAME with hyphens replaced by underscores. Python distribution \u00b6 Known \u00b6 Setting the PYAPP_PYTHON_VERSION option will determine the distribution used at runtime based on the environment at build time. If unset then the default will be the latest stable minor version of CPython . CPython \u00b6 ID 3.7 3.8 3.9 3.10 3.11 The source of distributions is the python-build-standalone project. Some distributions have variants that may be configured with the PYAPP_DISTRIBUTION_VARIANT option: Platform Options Linux v1 v2 v3 (default) v4 Windows shared (default) static Custom \u00b6 You may explicitly set the PYAPP_DISTRIBUTION_SOURCE option which overrides the known distribution settings. The source must be a URL that points to an archived version of the desired Python distribution. Setting this manually may require you to define extra metadata about the distribution that is required for correct runtime behavior . Format \u00b6 The following formats are supported for the PYAPP_DISTRIBUTION_FORMAT option, with the default chosen based on the ending of the source URL: Format Extensions Description tar|gzip .tar.gz .tgz A tar file with gzip compression tar|zstd .tar.zst .tar.zstd A tar file with Zstandard compression zip .zip A ZIP file with DEFLATE compression Python location \u00b6 You may set the relative path to the Python executable after unpacking the archive with the PYAPP_DISTRIBUTION_PYTHON_PATH option. The default is python.exe on Windows and bin/python3 on all other platforms. Embedding \u00b6 You may set the PYAPP_DISTRIBUTION_EMBED option to true or 1 to embed the distribution in the executable at build time to avoid fetching it at runtime. When distribution embedding is enabled, you can set the PYAPP_DISTRIBUTION_PATH option to use a local path rather than fetching the source. pip \u00b6 These options have no effect when the project installation is disabled . Externally managed \u00b6 You may set the PYAPP_PIP_EXTERNAL option to true or 1 to use the standalone versions of pip rather than whatever the distribution provides. By default, the latest version is used. You may use a specific X.Y.Z version by setting the PYAPP_PIP_VERSION option. Tip This provides a significant installation speed up when full isolation is not enabled. Extra arguments \u00b6 You may set the PYAPP_PIP_EXTRA_ARGS option to provide extra arguments to the pip install command at runtime when installing or updating the project e.g. --index-url URL --only-binary :all: . Allowing configuration \u00b6 You may set the PYAPP_PIP_ALLOW_CONFIG option to true or 1 to allow the use of environment variables and other configuration at runtime. Isolation \u00b6 You may set the PYAPP_FULL_ISOLATION option to true or 1 to provide each installation with a full copy of the distribution rather than a virtual environment. Skipping project installation \u00b6 You may set the PYAPP_SKIP_INSTALL option to true or 1 to skip installing the project in the distribution. This allows for entirely predefined distributions and thus no network calls at runtime if used in conjunction with distribution embedding . Installation indicator \u00b6 The environment variable that is used for detection may be set to the path of the executable at runtime if you set the PYAPP_PASS_LOCATION option to true or 1 . This is useful if your application wishes to in some way manage itself. Management command \u00b6 You may set the PYAPP_SELF_COMMAND option to override the default name ( self ) of the management command group . Setting this to none effectively disables the use of management commands. When enabled, the value will be available at runtime as the PYAPP_COMMAND_NAME environment variable. Metadata template \u00b6 You may set a custom template used to output metadata with the PYAPP_METADATA_TEMPLATE option which supports the following placeholders: Placeholder Description {project} The normalized project name {version} The currently installed version of the project The default template is {project} v{version} if this option is unset. This is useful for setting custom commands for the Starship prompt. The following example configuration assumes that the built executable has been renamed to foo : format = \"\"\" ... ${custom.foo}\\ ... $line_break\\ ... $character\"\"\" # <clipped> [custom.foo] command = \"foo self metadata\" when = true ## Windows # shell = [\"cmd\", \"/C\"] ## Other # shell = [\"sh\", \"--norc\"]","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"config/#configuration","text":"All configuration is done with environment variables.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"config/#project","text":"There are 3 ways to configure runtime installation, none of which will occur when disabled .
